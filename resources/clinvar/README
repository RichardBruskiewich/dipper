# Clinvar

Including some snapshots of the metadata to help track changes

Main file is:

wget --timestamping "https://archive.monarchinitiative.org/DipperCache/clinvar/ClinVarFullRelease_00-latest.xml.gz"

may be less resources to symlink to one in dipper/raw/


To get a canonical snapshot of the structure.

note: 
This produces the superposition of all the structures 
so not every stanza is guarenteed to contain every path 


# be warned, xml is currently at 14G, 
# and this takes a very long time to finish  (~ 1.5 hours)  ... or my machine is hosed
