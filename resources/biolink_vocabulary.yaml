# This is a YAML file consumed by BiolinkVocabulary class in order to categorize
# everything we ingest using biolink model categories.
#
# This file is used to populate an Enum with such that each term is a name, and the
# value for each term is a curie for the term, formed by prepended the term with
# `curie_prefix`. The CURIEs are used to assign biolink categories to entities we
# ingest, for example:
#
# OMIM:135800 biolink:category biolink:Disease .
#
# Each member of 'terms' below (except "category") should be a biolink model class, in
# camel case. No spaces or metacharacters. If you need to add an item for something
# that isn't already here consult this YAML file:
# https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/blob/master/biolink-model.yaml
