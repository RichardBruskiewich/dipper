# This is a YAML file consumed by BiolinkVocabulary class in order to categorize
# everything we ingest using biolink model categories.
#
# Each item below (except "category") should be a biolink model class, in camel case.
# No spaces or metacharacters. These items will be prepended with `curie_prefix`
# to make a curie for the predicate and object of the triple that categorizes the
# item in question. For example:
#
# OMIM:135800 biolink:category biolink:Disease
#
# If you need to add an item for something that isn't already here
# consult this YAML file:
# https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/blob/master/biolink-model.yaml
